     Because plug-ins interact with Locale as a background service, plug-ins MUST be installed to internal memory. This is
    consistent with Google's app install location guidelines: <http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/install-location.html#Should>.
    Note that Locale will reject plug-ins set to either installLocation="auto" OR installLocation="preferExternal". A plug-in MUST
    specify "internalOnly" or omit the android:installLocation attribute entirely.
