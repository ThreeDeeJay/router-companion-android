DD-WRT Companion for android
-------

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.rm3l.org/buildStatus/icon?job=DD-WRT_Companion__Android)](https://jenkins.rm3l.org/job/DD-WRT_Companion__Android)

Had you ever tried to use the DD-WRT web interface on an Android device, you should have noticed how impractical it is to navigate with.

This app aims at making DD-WRT devices management and monitoring a breeze, right from you Android-powered device.
